# divvy_customer_behavior
## Using: R language via R-Studio
An analysis of user behavior for the Divvy bike share service in Chicago.

A full walkthrough of the data manipulation, analysis, and visualization generation (all done entirely within R via RStudio) is provided in the RMD markdown file. A PDF version of the same info, which includes code outputs and visualizations, is also provided.

Only a small portion of the data used in this case study is provided here as an example. A link to download the full dataset can be found in the RMD or PDF.

For immediate access to the full dataset used, as well as an interactive version of the RMD file, see my Kaggle notebook for this project here: https://www.kaggle.com/c137tparker/case-study-divvy-bike-rides
